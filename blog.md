As of lately, I've had a few projects that I have been working on, but the current project I've been doing, is essentially that I have been playing around with a new server that is being borrowed from my dad's office. It is a large Dell PowerEdge R820 and honestly has more power than what I will ever need (or so I've been told). With that said, I have found a way to use up pretty much all of said power, by using it to run virtual machines. The reason the virtual machines are about to use up so much power, is that a virtual machine makes use of physical resources in order to run virtual computers.

My project for this week, was to set up a PXE server (which turned out to be unsuccessful). A PXE server is used to allow the installation of operating systems over the network. The way it works, is when a PXE enabled client boots, it obtains an IP address from a DHCP server, it then discovers the Proxy DHCP server that provides the client with a list of Boot Servers. The client obtains the name of the network bootstrap program (NBP) from the appropriate Boot Server. Finally, the client uses TFTP to download the NBP from the Boot Server and then executes it. This should be especially valuable to imaging software which will allow functions normally performed by a boot disk to be sent via the network.

Over the weekend, the project that I had set up was creating a private World of Warcraft server. The setup steps involved first compliling the server using a c++ compiler called Microsoft Visual Studio, extracting the map files from the original game, and then the setup of the server's databases. If you want to join, all you need to do is download the client that I have preconfigured from [https://this.bakunet.me/wowstuff/WoWWOTLK.zip](https://this.bakunet.me/wowstuff/WoWWOTLK.zip)

All you will need to do is run the "wow.exe" file within the folder!

Lately, my main project that I have been working on is buying a few cheap domains, acquiring some pretty funky email addresses, and setting up my own email server that I share with others.

With the emails that I have obtained, I've managed to get the following: admin@bakunet.me admin@shadowsynth.xyz admin@did-i.win and thisisthe@national.shitposting.agency

If you have any requests for email addresses, simply send an email [here](mailto:chosensoundmusic147@gmail.com)

Alright, so I have revamped the look and style of the blog. I would have kept the original subdomain in use, but github was not letting me do this.

Alright, so I will be using this as a blog for my English Class,  so here it is.


So, a few of my projects that I've been working on have been things like doing remakes of music from Pokemon games, working with game servers and websites, this blog page, and even my own screenshot server.

 Here is an example of what I have been doing with the music:

Over the weekend, the project that I had set up was creating a private World of Warcraft server. The setup steps involved first compliling the server using a c++ compiler called Microsoft Visual Studio, extracting the map files from the original game, and then the setup of the server's databases. If you want to join, all you need to do is download the client that I have preconfigured from [https://this.bakunet.me/wowstuff/WoWWOTLK.zip](https://this.bakunet.me/wowstuff/WoWWOTLK.zip)
All you will need to do is run the "wow.exe" file within the folder!

Lately, my main project that I have been working on is buying a few cheap domains, acquiring some pretty funky email addresses, and setting up my own email server that I share with others.

With the emails that I have obtained, I've managed to get the following: admin@bakunet.me admin@shadowsynth.xyz admin@did-i.win and thisisthe@national.shitposting.society

If you have any requests for email addresses, simply send an email [here](mailto:chosensoundmusic147@gmail.com)

Alright, so I have revamped the look and style of the blog. I would have kept the original subdomain in use, but github was not letting me do this.

Alright, so I will be using this as a blog for my English Class,  so here it is.


So, a few of my projects that I've been working on have been things like doing remakes of music from Pokemon games, working with game servers and websites, this blog page, and even my own screenshot server.

 Here is an example of what I have been doing with the music:
